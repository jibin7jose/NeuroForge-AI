# Contributing to NeuroForge AI

We love your input! We want to make contributing to NeuroForge AI as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache-2.0 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same Apache-2.0 License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.
